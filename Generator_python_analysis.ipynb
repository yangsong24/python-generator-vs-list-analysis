    "## Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment demonstrates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Time\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generator expressions** and **list comprehensions** have very similar execution times, with generator expressions being slightly faster on average. This similarity in execution time indicates that both methods are efficient for small-scale operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generator expressions** use significantly less memory compared to list comprehensions. This is because generator expressions produce items on-the-fly and do not store the entire list in memory. This makes generators particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when memory efficiency is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution**: The list comprehension `[x**10 for x in range(10)]` creates a list of 10 items, where each item is `x**10`.\n",
    "- **Memory Consumption**: The entire list is created and stored in memory, which consumes more memory.\n",
    "- **Time Consumption**: The time taken includes the time to create the list and iterate over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generator Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution**: The generator expression `(x**10 for x in range(10))` creates a generator object that produces items on-the-fly.\n",
    "- **Memory Consumption**: The generator object itself is small and does not store the entire list in memory. It only keeps track of the current state and yields the next value when required.\n",
    "- **Time Consumption**: The time taken is primarily for the iteration, as the values are computed on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List Comprehension**: Use when you need to store the entire list in memory for multiple iterations or when the list size is small and memory usage is not a concern.\n",
    "- **Generator Expression**: Use when you need to iterate over items once and want to minimize memory usage, especially with large datasets or infinite sequences. (*Data Streaming cases*)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment highlights the efficiency of generator expressions in terms of both execution time and memory usage compared to list comprehensions. Generators are a powerful tool for optimizing memory consumption and improving performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or **streams of data**.\n"
